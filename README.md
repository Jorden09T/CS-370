What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code that was given was the TreasureMaze.py, GameExperience.py and TreasureHuntGame.IPYNB. The code that was developed by myself was in the Q learning section where we developed the game loops, actions and rewards for the game.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists create software and hardware to solve problems and develop new computing technologies. Their work is important as it helps people work more efficiently and solve complex problems in many fields. 

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Computer scientists approach a problem by first thoroughly understanding the problem statement, break it down into smaller, manageable parts, identify potential solutions using relevant algorithms and data structures, evaluate their efficiency, implement the chosen solution, and finally test and optimize it for different scenarios and edge cases.
